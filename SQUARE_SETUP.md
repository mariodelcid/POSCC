# Square Payment Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up Square payment processing in your POS system.

## Prerequisites

1. **Square Developer Account**: Sign up at [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/)
2. **Square Business Account**: You need an active Square business account
3. **Node.js**: Version 18.18 or higher

## Step 1: Get Square API Credentials

1. Go to [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/)
2. Create a new application or select an existing one
3. Navigate to **Credentials** in your app
4. Copy your **Access Token** and **Application ID**
5. Go to **Locations** and copy your **Location ID**

## Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Square API Configuration
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token_here
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_square_location_id_here
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_square_application_id_here

# Optional: Webhook URL for production
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/square/webhook

# Local Development
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Step 3: Test the Integration

1. Start your development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your POS system at `http://localhost:5173`

3. Add items to cart and test the payment flow
